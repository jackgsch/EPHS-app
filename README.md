# EPHS-app

Inspiration for this app is rooted around what me and my team thought would be beneficial for students around our school. EPHS-App is a place for students to connect with their schoolwork like never before. Direct communication with teachers, an automatically updated to-do list with their homework. Our app is connected to Schoology which is our school wide online platform.

I have personally taken up tasks of addidng and modifying different views which are controlled by teh menu bar at the bottom of the screen. Additonally, I retrieved and edited images and then uploaded the images to the app to use over buttons. I also spent time designing teh AppIcon and uploaded it as well. I have bee trouble shooting bugs as they arise and have work with my team to lay out a plan for our app and a timeline for when we will get tasks done.
